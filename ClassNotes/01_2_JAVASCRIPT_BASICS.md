## Interpreted Vs Compiled languages

| Compiled | Interpreted |
|:--------:|:-----------:|
|Entire code needs to compile first| Runs code line by line|
|If there is an error in code, entire program stops| runs the code till the line containing error|
|C++, Java, Rust, Golang|javascript, python|

## Why Javascript
All the web requires some level of javascript. To replace js completely will mean all websites in the world change and new borwsers need to be created.

## Strict Vs Dynamic
> see code

## Single threaded nature of JS
Javascript can only ever run 1 thread and use 1 core of the machine. So it is a bad language for scalable systems.

## Simple premitives in JS(number, string, boolean)

## Complex premitives in JS(arrays, objects)

## Functions in JS

## Callback functions

## Synchronous Vs Asynchoronous Programming in Javascript

|Synchoronous|Asynchoronous|
|:----------:|:-----------:|
|All code runs line by line. Next line is not started till current line execution is not finished.|Asynchoronous functions can be used to start long running operations while other parts of the code are also running without waiting for the long running process to complete|

Let’s write some code -
1. Write a program prints all the even numbers in an array
2. Write a program to print the biggest number in an arrya
3. Write a program that prints all the male people’s first name given a complex object
4. Write a program that reverses all the elements of an array

Assignments
 Create a counter in Javascript (counts down from 30 to 0)
2. Calculate the time it takes between a setTimeout call and the inner function actually running
3. Create a terminal clock (HH:MM:SS)

## Event loops, callback queue, Promises
